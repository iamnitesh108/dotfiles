# s/         - substitute command
# \([KMGT]\) - capture K, M, G, or T (the unit letter) into group 1
# i          - match the 'i' immediately after the unit letter
# /\1/       - replace with what was captured in group 1 (effectively removing 'i')
# g          - global replacement (replace all occurrences on the line)
